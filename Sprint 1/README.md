### Day [2] - Scrum Meeting summary


The Scrum Master for this meeting was Tony Wright


Members Present: Michael, Joel, Jodie, Tony, Dimitar, Ben


Members Not Present: none


## Summary of Conversation: 

Tony + Joel, continued working on functionality for the website, after speaking to other members, we have changed the design to make it easier to identify which search options the user is wanting to use. Currently setting up the connection to the new database through netbeans and setting up a push to the github and displaying dynamic results depending on search options - Joel was having a few problems pushing with the IDE, although shouldn't take too long to fix

Michael - Completed template map, uploaded to github, waiting for dataset to be uploaded to the database to run further tests and complete functionality

Jodie - Completed 'Create function to restrict search to a distance range' task, currently setting up and populating the database

Benjamin - Has completed the majority of assigned tasks, just 'Create an order by distance function', currently continuing work on

Dimitar - Has been assigned to work with Tony and Joel on displaying the search results, also the task 'Display a combination of search results in one list'

As everything is on track, the goal for tomorrow is to start intergrating the search algorithms into the website to test with the database.
